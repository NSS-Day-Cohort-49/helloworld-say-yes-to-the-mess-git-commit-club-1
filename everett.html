                Suva (Fijian pronunciation: [ˈsuβa]) is the capital of Fiji, and its largest metropolitan
                city. It is located on the southeast coast of the island of Viti Levu, in Rewa Province,

                Lautoka is the second largest city in Fiji. It is on the west coast of the island of 
                Viti Levu, in the Ba Province of the Western Division. Lying in the heart of Fiji's sugar 
                cane-growing region, the city has come to be known as the Sugar City. Covering an area of 32 square kilometres, 
                it had a population of 71,573 at the 2017 census, the most recent to date.

                2012 estimate showed that the population had grown to over 50,000. Nadi is multiracial with many of its inhabitants 
                Asians, Indian or Indigenous Fijians, along with a large transient population of foreign tourists. Along with sugar cane
